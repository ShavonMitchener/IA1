          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Determined:</strong>  
              My determination helps me stay committed to my goals, especially when schoolwork becomes 
              challenging. It pushes me to complete assignments on time and study consistently, even 
              when I feel overwhelmed.

              <strong>Creative:</strong>  
              Creativity allows me to approach academic tasks from different angles. Whether it’s 
              solving technical problems or preparing presentations, I use original ideas to make 
              my work stand out and find unique solutions.

            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Adaptive:</strong>  
              Being adaptive helps me adjust quickly to new subjects, teaching styles, or group 
              projects. It makes it easier to work with different classmates and stay calm when 
              unexpected changes happen in school.
            </li>
          </ul>

              <strong>Spending Time with Friends:</strong>  
              Socializing with friends helps me maintain emotional balance and reduce stress, which keeps me motivated and focused during challenging school assignments and exams.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Playing Video Games:</strong>  
              Gaming improves my quick thinking, decision-making, and concentration. These skills help me stay alert in class and solve academic problems more effectively, especially in technical subjects.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Reading Manga:</strong>  
              Reading manga boosts my creativity and imagination. It also gives me mental breaks that prevent burnout, allowing me to return to studying with a fresh and relaxed mindset.

          <p>For twenty long years, the thirteenth saint Lee Geon was trapped inside the 
            Tower of Demons after being backstabbed by twelve of his allies. These twelve 
            “saints” were warriors chosen by the twelve Zodiac gods to defeat mysterious 
            monsters called “calamities” that were massacring the planet. Though no god 
            had chosen Geon as a saint, he became the mightiest of them all, which made 
            him a hero… and a target. But now, Geon has brawled his way out of the tower, 
            and he’s back stronger than ever. All that’s left is to exact brutal payback 
            on each of the saints, but none of these powerful beings will go down without

        <h2>My Hero</h2>: 
        <p><strong>Christian Bale</strong></p>
        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; margin: 10px 0;">
          "If you have a problem with me text me, if you don't have my number
          you don't know me well enough to have a problem with me" 
          <br>— <i>Christian Bale</i>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="hero-background" style="margin-top: 20px;">
      <h3>Background Information</h3>
      <p>
        Christian Bale, born on January 30, 1974, in Pembrokeshire, Wales, began his career as a child 
        and became a highly versatile actor. His family has a strong performing arts background, with 
        a mother who was a dancer and a clown, an actress sister, and a grandfather who worked as a 
        stunt double for John Wayne in the 1962 film Hatari!
      </p>
      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        I chose Christian Bale as my hero because his quote, “If you have a problem with me text me, 
        if you don’t have my number you don’t know me well enough to have a problem with me,” really 
        resonates with me. It reminds me not to waste energy worrying about what distant people think, 
        and instead to focus on those who truly know and understand me. If someone is close enough to 
        have my number, it means they’re close enough to talk things through honestly. Anyone outside of 
        that circle doesn’t need to have an opinion that affects my peace of mind.

      <h2>AI Business Idea Review</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Chosen Idea:</strong> AI-Powered Virtual Assistants
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone uses a virtual assistant, be it asking Siri to set an alarm or using a personal 
        finance app to create expense reports. Virtual assistants and agents are great AI-based 
        business ideas for startups to build products of exponential value.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Assistants:</strong> Automating workflows like sending emails, paying bills, ordering groceries, or booking appointments.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Support Assistants:</strong> AI chatbots acting as service agents to help users find information and solve issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Assistants:</strong> Specialized AI in stock trading, weather, travel booking, or research.</li>
        <li><strong>Executive Assistants:</strong> AI that helps leaders schedule meetings, summarize documents, and plan follow-ups.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Application in My World</h3>
      <p>
        As a Computer Network Security student, a virtual assistant could help me 
        organize my study schedule, automate reminders for assignments, and even 
        summarize long technical readings into manageable notes. This would improve 
        my time management and academic productivity.
      </p>

      <h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>
      <p>
        The main concerns with virtual assistants are data privacy and over-dependence 
        on AI. Since these assistants collect sensitive personal information, there is 
        always the risk of misuse, hacking, or data leaks.
      </p>

      <h3>My Solution</h3>
      <p>
        To address these issues, companies should implement strong encryption, 
        transparent privacy policies, and give users full control over their data. 
        Virtual assistants should act as a supplement to, not a replacement for, human 
        judgment and decision-making.
      </p>

      <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>
      Two powerful examples of virtual assistants today are 
      <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> by OpenAI 
      and <a href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Gemini</a>. 
      These AI assistants can hold conversations, answer questions, create content, 
      and even help with productivity tasks like summarizing documents or generating ideas. 
      They demonstrate how AI can provide practical support to individuals, students, 
      and professionals alike.
